=========================
Multilevel (nested) ticks
=========================

Sometimes we want another level of tick labels on an axis, perhaps to indicate
a grouping of the ticks.

Matplotlib does not provide an automated way to do this, but it is relatively
straightforward to annotate below the main axis.

These examples use `.Axes.secondary_xaxis`, which is one approach. It has the
advantage that we can use Matplotlib Locators and Formatters on the axis that
does the grouping if we want.

This first example creates a secondary xaxis and manually adds the ticks and
labels using `.Axes.set_xticks`.  Note that the tick labels have a newline
(e.g. ``"
Oughts"``) at the beginning of them to put the second-level tick
labels below the main tick labels.

This second example adds a second level of annotation to a categorical axis.
Here we need to note that each animal (category) is assigned an integer, so
``cats`` is at x=0, ``dogs`` at x=1 etc.  Then we place the ticks on the
second level on an x that is at the middle of the animal class we are trying
to delineate.

This example also adds tick marks between the classes by adding a second
secondary xaxis, and placing long, wide ticks at the boundaries between the
animal classes.

Dates are another common place where we may want to have a second level of
tick labels.  In this last example, we take advantage of the ability to add
an automatic locator and formatter to the secondary xaxis, which means we do
not need to set the ticks manually.

This example also differs from the above, in that we placed it at a location
below the main axes ``location=-0.075`` and then we hide the spine by setting
the line width to zero.  That means that our formatter no longer needs the
carriage returns of the previous two examples.

    ax.plot(time, rng.random(size=len(time)))

    # just format the days:
    ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(mdates.DateFormatter('%d'))

    # label the months:
    sec = ax.secondary_xaxis(location=-0.075)
    sec.xaxis.set_major_locator(mdates.MonthLocator(bymonthday=1))

    # note the extra spaces in the label to align the month label inside the month.
    # Note that this could have been done by changing ``bymonthday`` above as well:
