================
Image resampling
================

Images are represented by discrete pixels assigned color values, either on the
screen or in an image file.  When a user calls `~.Axes.imshow` with a data
array, it is rare that the size of the data array exactly matches the number of
pixels allotted to the image in the figure, so Matplotlib resamples or `scales
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling>`_ the data or image to fit.  If
the data array is larger than the number of pixels allotted in the rendered figure,
then the image will be "down-sampled" and image information will be lost.
Conversely, if the data array is smaller than the number of output pixels then each
data point will get multiple pixels, and the image is "up-sampled".

In the following figure, the first data array has size (450, 450), but is
represented by far fewer pixels in the figure, and hence is down-sampled.  The
second data array has size (4, 4), and is represented by far more pixels, and
hence is up-sampled.

Matplotlib's `~.Axes.imshow` method has two keyword arguments to allow the user
to control how resampling is done.  The *interpolation* keyword argument allows
a choice of the kernel that is used for resampling, allowing either `anti-alias
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing_filter>`_ filtering if
down-sampling, or smoothing of pixels if up-sampling.  The
*interpolation_stage* keyword argument, determines if this smoothing kernel is
applied to the underlying data, or if the kernel is applied to the RGBA pixels.

``interpolation_stage='rgba'``: Data -> Normalize -> RGBA -> Interpolate/Resample

``interpolation_stage='data'``: Data -> Interpolate/Resample -> Normalize -> RGBA

For both keyword arguments, Matplotlib has a default "antialiased", that is
recommended for most situations, and is described below.  Note that this
default behaves differently if the image is being down- or up-sampled, as
described below.

Down-sampling and modest up-sampling
====================================

When down-sampling data, we usually want to remove aliasing by smoothing the
image first and then sub-sampling it.  In Matplotlib, we can do that smoothing
before mapping the data to colors, or we can do the smoothing on the RGB(A)
image pixels.  The differences between these are shown below, and controlled
with the *interpolation_stage* keyword argument.

The following images are down-sampled from 450 data pixels to approximately
125 pixels or 250 pixels (depending on your display).
The underlying image has alternating +1, -1 stripes on the left side, and
a varying wavelength (`chirp <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirp>`_) pattern
in the rest of the image.  If we zoom, we can see this detail without any
down-sampling:

If we down-sample, the simplest algorithm is to decimate the data using
`nearest-neighbor interpolation
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_interpolation>`_.  We can
do this in either data space or RGBA space:

Nearest interpolation is identical in data and RGBA space, and both exhibit
`Moiré <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moiré_pattern>`_ patterns because the
high-frequency data is being down-sampled and shows up as lower frequency
patterns. We can reduce the Moiré patterns by applying an anti-aliasing filter
to the image before rendering:

The `Hanning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hann_function>`_ filter smooths
the underlying data so that each new pixel is a weighted average of the
original underlying pixels.  This greatly reduces the Moiré patterns.
However, when the *interpolation_stage* is set to 'data', it also introduces
white regions to the image that are not in the original data, both in the
alternating bands on the left hand side of the image, and in the boundary
between the red and blue of the large circles in the middle of the image.
The interpolation at the 'rgba' stage has a different artifact, with the alternating
bands coming out a shade of purple; even though purple is not in the original
colormap, it is what we perceive when a blue and red stripe are close to each
other.

The default for the *interpolation* keyword argument is 'auto' which
will choose a Hanning filter if the image is being down-sampled or up-sampled
by less than a factor of three.  The default *interpolation_stage* keyword
argument is also 'auto', and for images that are down-sampled or
up-sampled by less than a factor of three it defaults to 'rgba'
interpolation.

Anti-aliasing filtering is needed, even when up-sampling. The following image
up-samples 450 data pixels to 530 rendered pixels. You may note a grid of
line-like artifacts which stem from the extra pixels that had to be made up.
Since interpolation is 'nearest' they are the same as a neighboring line of
pixels and thus stretch the image locally so that it looks distorted.

Apart from the default 'hanning' anti-aliasing, `~.Axes.imshow` supports a
number of different interpolation algorithms, which may work better or
worse depending on the underlying data.

A final example shows the desirability of performing the anti-aliasing at the
RGBA stage when using non-trivial interpolation kernels.  In the following,
the data in the upper 100 rows is exactly 0.0, and data in the inner circle
is exactly 2.0. If we perform the *interpolation_stage* in 'data' space and
use an anti-aliasing filter (first panel), then floating point imprecision
makes some of the data values just a bit less than zero or a bit more than
2.0, and they get assigned the under- or over- colors. This can be avoided if
you do not use an anti-aliasing filter (*interpolation* set set to
'nearest'), however, that makes the part of the data susceptible to Moiré
patterns much worse (second panel).  Therefore, we recommend the default
*interpolation* of 'hanning'/'auto', and *interpolation_stage* of
'rgba'/'auto' for most down-sampling situations (last panel).

The *interpolation* keyword argument can be used to smooth the pixels if desired.
However, that almost always is better done in data space, rather than in RGBA space
where the filters can cause colors that are not in the colormap to be the result of
the interpolation.  In the following example, note that when the interpolation is
'rgba' there are red colors as interpolation artifacts.  Therefore, the default
'auto' choice for *interpolation_stage* is set to be the same as 'data'
when up-sampling is greater than a factor of three:

Avoiding resampling
===================

It is possible to avoid resampling data when making an image.  One method is
to simply save to a vector backend (pdf, eps, svg) and use
``interpolation='none'``.  Vector backends allow embedded images, however be
aware that some vector image viewers may smooth image pixels.

The second method is to exactly match the size of your axes to the size of
your data. The following figure is exactly 2 inches by 2 inches, and
if the dpi is 200, then the 400x400 data is not resampled at all. If you download
this image and zoom in an image viewer you should see the individual stripes
on the left hand side (note that if you have a non hiDPI or "retina" screen, the html
may serve a 100x100 version of the image, which will be downsampled.)
