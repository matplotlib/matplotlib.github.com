===========
MovieWriter
===========

This example uses a MovieWriter directly to grab individual frames and write
them to a file. This avoids any event loop integration, but has the advantage
of working with even the Agg backend. This is not recommended for use in an
interactive setting.

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib
    matplotlib.use("Agg")
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.animation as manimation

    # Fixing random state for reproducibility
    np.random.seed(19680801)


    FFMpegWriter = manimation.writers['ffmpeg']
    metadata = dict(title='Movie Test', artist='Matplotlib',
                    comment='Movie support!')
    writer = FFMpegWriter(fps=15, metadata=metadata)

    fig = plt.figure()
    l, = plt.plot([], [], 'k-o')
